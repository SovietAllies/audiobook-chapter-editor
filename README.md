# Audiobook Chapter Editor
Generate and edit chapters within m4b files. Convert mp3 to m4b and add chapters.

You'll be able to upload an mp3 or m4b file and then scan fo silence within the audio to determine chapters.

You can select how long the silence has to be to determine chapter start. 2.5 seconds generally works for most audio files, but some may need more.
If you only have a single mp3 file, you can convert it within the application to m4b file and then apply chapters and metadata.
